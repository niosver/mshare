# Music Clip Sharing Demo

**_Google Cloud Host is temporarily down due to letsencrypt rate limits_**

This project is a demo of a music sharing method that involves users owning playlists that others can write-only music clips to sent along with messages. The inspiration is to solve the issue of sharing specific songs or parts of songs happen off-platform because the complication or overhead of setting up collaborative playlists is too cumbersome for many users.

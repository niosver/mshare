# Music Clip Sharing Demo

**_Host is temporarily down due to letsencrypt rate limits_**

#### Hosted at mshare.niosver.app


This project is a demo of a music sharing method that involves users owning playlists that others can write-only music clips to sent along with messages. The inspiration is to solve the issue of sharing specific songs or parts of songs happen off-platform because the complication or overhead of setting up collaborative playlists is too cumbersome for many users when they only want to send one or a few songs at a time. The sharing to special playlists is enabled by default when becoming a friend with another user. Each sharing playlist can be configured to set who can write to it, but to remove complications from the sender they select only the user to send to. Users also are allowed to send clips to their followers as well. This allows artists or other influences to send clips and messages to users without the friending requirement and allowing others to write to their playlists.

#### Spotify API limits

**Unfortunately Spotify now limits API requests to 25 users you manually register on the Developer Console so accessing the app is limited. So bewlow are some screen captures of the application. If you would like to access it for yourself send me a request so I can add you to the console.**

When a user deletes their playlist, all friends/the people they follow that are attached to that playlist will be reassigned to the default playlist that can not be deleted.

#### Configuring Who Can Share

For the simplicity of the user sending the clips and to remove barriers there, each friend can only be assigned to a single playlist to write to. This can be changed, but they will be removed from the original playlist they were attached to.
